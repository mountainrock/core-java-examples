== 1. What is the difference between static and instance method? ==
   Instance methods can be called by the object of a Class whereas static method are called by the Class.

 When objects of a Class are created, they have their own copy of instance methods and variables, stored in different memory locations.

 Static Methods and variables are shared among all the objects of the Class, stored in one fixed location in memory.Static methods cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly-they must use an object reference. Also, class methods cannot use the this keyword as there is no instance for this to refer to.
